== SYNOPSIS:

Descriptive configuration files for Ruby using Ruby.

== DESCRIPTION:

You've written a great new piece of code that is configurable but comes with
sensible defaults so that others can start using it quickly. Now it is time to
document all those configuration options so your adoring fans can wield your
code in anger.

This is where Loquacious comes in -- a configuration system with baked in
documentation and help. Loquacious allows you to describe your configuration
options and use those descriptions to print pretty help messages.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install loquacious
